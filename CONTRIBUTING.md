# How to contribute
Anyone can contribute. To contribute, just edit [README.md](README.md) in your fork and make a pull request.

The easiest way to to this is to press the pencil button on the top right of [README.md](README.md) - add your resource, then follow through to make a pull request.

**Formatting guides**
- Add your resource in the format
```
[Resource Name](https://link.to/resource) - description of resource, no beginning capital letter/full stop
```
- Find the relevant section for your resource - if there are similar resources this may help, otherwise you can make your own section
- Put your resource (or new category) in **alphabetical order**
